// is wokay's and the licence calls are flambeau's, and the two backends will not become
// real on the same day. flambeau have built no licence endpoint at all — the two they
// have are both authentication — and wokay's catalogue endpoints arrive Week 3 at the
// earliest. One switch for both would force a choice nobody wants to make: real licences
// against fixture books, or the reverse.

// matched, so it survives into the bundle as a lookup on an object that is not there and
// evaluates to `undefined` — silently, and only in a production build.
