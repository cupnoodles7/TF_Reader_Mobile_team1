// src/features/personalization/useReaderPrefs.ts
// The one seam between the reader-preferences screen and `prefsStore`.
//
// ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The screen never imports `prefsStore` directly. It calls this hook, and the
// hook calls whatever `PrefsSource` it was handed — `PrefsSource` below is an
// interface THIS file owns, which `prefsStore` satisfies structurally (same
// four function names, same signatures, no shared base type).
//
// INJECTED, NOT IMPORTED, and the reason is the one `useCatalogueSearch` already
// gives for injecting its pipeline: "so a test or a gallery entry can drive this
// with latency, an injected failure, or a stub, without touching a process-wide
// singleton." Every test in useReaderPrefs.test.ts passes a fake source; none of
// them touches AsyncStorage. The default below is the real store — see
// `UseReaderPrefsOptions.source`.
//
// ─── WHAT THE HOOK GUARANTEES, SO NO SECTION HAS TO ──────────────────────────
//
// NESTED GROUPS ARE SPREAD BEFORE THEY ARE PATCHED, AT TWO LEVELS.
// `SharedPrefs.font` is an object, and `savePrefs({ font: { family } })` would
// drop `customFontUri` — the store replaces a group wholesale rather than
// merging into it. That rule is easy to get right once and easy to forget at
// the fourth call site, so the spread happens in here and a section only ever
// names the field it changed. The same protection is available to Keshav's
// Layout and Prayas's Typography sections if they route their writes through
// this hook.
//
// THE SECOND LEVEL IS FOR ACCESSIBILITY. Hruthik's contract (v1.1 §1) states the
// same rule and notes it "bites twice" for that group: `accessibility` is a
// group, and `text` / `display` / `announce` are groups inside it, so a patch
// naming one field can wipe a sibling at either depth. `write` now expands a
// patch against the current values at both levels — see `expandPatch`.
//
// TWO LEVELS, NOT ARBITRARY DEPTH, and that is the contract's shape rather than
// a limitation worth removing. A general deep merge would also quietly merge a
// value that was meant to replace, which is the harder bug to see.
//
// WRITES ARE OPTIMISTIC AND REVERT ON FAILURE. A settings control that waits on
// a promise before moving feels broken, and prefs are local-first by contract —
// the client stamps `updatedAt` at edit time, offline, before any sync. So the
// value moves immediately and rolls back if the write rejects, with `saveFailed`
// raised for the screen to report. The alternative — awaiting each write — makes
// every tap feel like a network call for data that never leaves the device.
