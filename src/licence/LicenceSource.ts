// src/licence/LicenceSource.ts
// The four licence calls, plus the two the offer needs and the one read they all
// depend on. THE SEAM: screens depend on this interface, never on HTTP.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `DataSource`. That seam is wokay's — a catalogue
// is public, cacheable, and the same for every reader in an institution. This one is
// flambeau's, and every call on it is about one reader: it needs a token, it mutates
// server state, and two readers asking the same question get different answers. Same
// Mock/Api pattern, different backend, different lifetime.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT PART OF `src/access`. `resolveAccess` decides which button to draw
// and is pure; this carries out what the button does and is all side effects. Keeping
// them apart is what lets a list of forty cards resolve for free — see the note at the
// top of `resolveAccess.ts`. The two meet in a screen, not in a file.
//
// EVERY METHOD IS NAMED FOR flambeau's OPERATION, not for what we used to call it.
// The old vocabulary — generate a licence, check a licence, revoke, join queue — is
// gone from the code. It survives only in the mapping table below, so that a message
// to flambeau and a function name in here cannot drift apart.
//
//   ours (13 Aug)        theirs                 here
//   generate a licence   borrow                 borrow
//   check a licence      open a reading session  openReadingSession
//   revoke               return                 returnLoan
//   join queue           place a hold           placeHold
//   —                    accept an offer        acceptOffer
//   —                    cancel a hold          cancelHold

  // unchanged, so re-joining cannot send someone to the back of a queue they were
  // already in.

  // "Declining an offer is a cancel; there is no separate decline endpoint."
  //
  // SO REJECT COSTS THE READER THEIR PLACE ENTIRELY. Cancelling an offered hold
  // releases the copy immediately and promotes the next waiter, and the hold is hard
  // deleted — "the only genuinely hard delete in this file". A reader who reads
  // "Reject" as "not now, keep my spot" is wrong, and that is a copy problem sitting
  // on the button rather than a problem with this call.

  // ids the two id-keyed calls need only exist for as long as the app stays open.

  // is what makes the rest of the interface usable rather than a nicety on top.

  // Whether we ask them for the key and call this ourselves, or hand them the item
  // and they call it, is open question 6 and nobody has claimed it.
  //
  // PRESENT ANYWAY, because the shape of the answer does not depend on who wins: if
  // it turns out to be ours, this is where it goes and no caller has to be reshaped.
  // Every implementation throws `NOT_OURS_YET` until then, which is a louder and more
  // findable answer than the method simply being absent.
