// src/components/SearchInput/SearchInput.tsx
// The one search field for BOTH search surfaces — catalogue (screens 01, 09) and
// institution (screen 06). Foundation Spec §6.5: the two pipelines differ on
// corpus, criticality and offline behaviour, but they share a single input.
//
// IT HOLDS NO QUERY STATE AND RUNS NO SEARCH. `value` in, `onChangeText` out — a
// controlled input. Debouncing, tokenising, ranking and fetching belong to the
// pipeline that owns the query (CONVENTIONS §3). The only thing this component
// owns is focus, which is local UI state and nobody else's business.
//
// THE MIC IS OPT-IN, VIA `onVoicePress` RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN. Voice (B11) is
// catalogue-scoped only, so institution search must not show it. There is no
// `showVoice` flag because a caller that wants the icon needs somewhere to send
// the press anyway — one prop cannot then contradict the other.
//
// It sets no outer margin, width or position (CONVENTIONS §8) — the search shell
// that lays it out owns that. That includes the design's overlap onto the navy
// header: a negative top margin belongs to the screen, not to this file.
//
// ONE THING THE DESIGN ASKS FOR THAT THE TOKENS CANNOT GIVE. The reference shows
// a WHITE card on a grey page. `tokens.ts` has no white — `color.surface` is
// #F8F9FA and is already the page background, so card and page are the same
// colour here and only the shadow and hairline separate them. CONVENTIONS §5
// says to raise a missing token rather than invent one, so this is raised for
// Khushi (tokens are single-authored) and not worked around locally.
