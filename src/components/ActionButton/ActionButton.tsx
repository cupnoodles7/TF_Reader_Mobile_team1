// One access action as one button: a label, an icon, and a callback.
//
// IT DOES NOT KNOW WHY IT EXISTS. It is handed an `action` and renders it. It
// never reads a tier, a session, a licence or an entitlement to decide its own
// label, its own weight, or whether it should be on screen at all — that is
// `src/access/resolveAccess` (CONVENTIONS §3, Design Spec §5.1 "the UI must
// never calculate access rights").
//
// This is what let the 12 August flow change and the 13 August Elite decisions
// land without touching this file: `borrow` stopped being a button, Elite lost
// its Download and started always queueing, and none of it is expressible here.

export type ActionEmphasis = 'filled' | 'outlined' | 'quiet';

// The lifecycle axis, kept separate from `action` so there is no
// `action="read-loading"` (CONVENTIONS §4).
//
// `done` is a spent action: tapped, accepted, and not to be tapped again.
//
// NOTHING DEFINES A `doneLabel` AS OF 16 AUG, and that is a consequence of the
// Elite flow change rather than an oversight. `addToQueue` was the only action
// that ever had one — it flipped to "Added to queue" in place, because the button
// had to stand in for its own aftermath. `grantAccess` does not: tapping it
// changes the RESOLVE (`requires_grant` becomes `queued` or `offered`), so the
// whole bar redraws and there is no spent button left to relabel.
//
// The mechanism stays because `done` still has a job — it renders a button inert,
// which is what stops a second tap landing on an offer that has already become a
// loan. It simply falls back to the normal label everywhere now, which is exactly
// what `doneLabel` being optional was for.

// Emphasis and icons are Akriti's call, 13 Aug — the eighteen design screens are
// reference only and they disagree with each other (screen 05 gives Read a book
// icon, screen 18 gives it none). `revokeLicence` is `quiet` because it is the
// only action that takes something away from the reader: it should be findable
// without competing with the button they came to press.
//
// WHY `rejectOffer` IS `outlined` AND NOT `quiet` — 16 Aug, and it is the one
// judgement call in this table worth arguing with. Reject also takes something
// away, so `quiet` looks right by analogy with `revokeLicence`. But `quiet` sends
// it to its own line beneath the row (see ActionBar), and Accept / Reject are two
// answers to one question: a reader offered a copy expects both choices at equal
// standing, side by side. Revoke is a rare action you should not hit by accident;
// Reject is one of exactly two expected replies. Different jobs, different weight.
// Flipping it back is one word here and nothing else.
