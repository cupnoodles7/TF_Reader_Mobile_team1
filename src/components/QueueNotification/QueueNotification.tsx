// QueueNotification — the in-app banner that offers a reader an Elite copy.
//
// A reader on the title's own detail screen already sees Accept and Reject:
// resolveAccess returns the `offered` state with `['acceptOffer', 'rejectOffer']`
// and ActionBar draws them. This banner is the same two actions for a reader who
// is somewhere else in the app, because an offer expires and cannot wait for them
// to navigate back.
//
// It knows nothing about licences, holds, stores or flambeau. It is told a title
// and how long is left, and it reports which button was pressed.
//
// IT USES ActionButton RATHER THAN DRAWING ITS OWN BUTTONS. `acceptOffer` and
// `rejectOffer` are two of the eight actions in the contract, and ActionButton
// already owns their labels, icons and emphasis. Drawing them again here would be
// a second implementation of the same two buttons (CONVENTIONS §7) and the two
// would drift the first time a label changed.
//
// UNLIKE OfflineBanner, THIS SETS NO POSITION OF ITS OWN. OfflineBanner overlays
// content and lets touches pass through it, so owning its own absolute position
// is what makes that guarantee enforceable. This banner has to be tapped, and
// design have not decided whether it sits at the top or rises from the bottom, so
// placement stays the caller's (CONVENTIONS §8).
