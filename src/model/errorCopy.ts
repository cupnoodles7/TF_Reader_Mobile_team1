// src/model/errorCopy.ts
// The single CatalogueError → copy map. Every screen with a catalogue-backed
// error state (search, home catalogue, shelf) reads from here rather than
// keeping its own — SearchScreen used to carry its own `ERROR_COPY`, and
// CatalogueScreen/ShelfScreen carried no code-specific copy at all, just a
// fixed "couldn't load" string regardless of why. One list means a code's
// wording only ever changes in one place, and a new CatalogueError member is a
// compile error here rather than a screen quietly falling back to nothing.
//
// KEYED ON CODE, NEVER ON HTTP STATUS. wokay's own vocabulary, not the
// transport's — see errors.ts. A reader is never shown a number.
