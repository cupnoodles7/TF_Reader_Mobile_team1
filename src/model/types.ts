// 'http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/borrow', a field is missing here — add it
// here rather than leaking the wire format upward.

// The OPDS acquisition rel, normalized to a closed union. A union, not a
// string, so an unrecognised rel fails loudly in rels.ts instead of flowing
// onward as an arbitrary value.
//
// NOT THE BUTTON VOCABULARY, and the distinction now matters. `borrow` here is
// the wire rel — literally what wokay's feed sends, and the contract still lists
// it. It survived the 12 Aug flow change untouched even though the borrow BUTTON
// did not; see ACTION_IDS below. Two similar words, only one of them moved.
//
//   http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/borrow       → 'borrow'
//   http://opds-spec.org/acquisition              → 'acquire'
//   http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access  → 'openAccess'
//   http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/subscribe    → 'subscribe'
//
// `subscribe` is the fourth rel, and it is the odd one: it leads to a page
// explaining how to get access, not to a file. So it carries no
// `indirectAcquisition`, which means no format can be derived from it.
export type AcquisitionRel = 'borrow' | 'acquire' | 'openAccess' | 'subscribe';

// The RESOLVED button vocabulary — what `AccessResult.actions` will hold once
// `src/access/resolveAccess` exists. Distinct from `AcquisitionRel` above: a
// rel says which acquisition mechanism a publication uses, this says which
// buttons to draw once session and licence state is folded in (e.g. an
// 'acquire' rel while signed out resolves to 'signIn', not 'acquire').
// Declared as a const array first, with the union derived from it, so
// validate.ts, the state gallery and ActionButton all enumerate the same
// runtime values the type is derived from — one definition, not several kept in
// sync by hand.
//
// EIGHT WORDS AS OF 16 AUG, and this is the first flow change that did not come
// free. `addToQueue` is GONE and three arrive in its place: `grantAccess`,
// `acceptOffer`, `rejectOffer`.
//
// The Elite flow it encodes: a reader holding nothing sees ONE button,
// `grantAccess`, on every surface. Tapping it either returns the offer straight
// away — nobody ahead of them — or puts them in the queue with a position and
// delivers the same offer later as a notification. Both routes end at the same
// `acceptOffer` / `rejectOffer` pair, which is the whole reason there is one
// offer surface and not two.
//
// WHY `addToQueue` HAD TO GO, and it is not just a rename. A queue position is a
// STATUS, not an action: a queued reader has nothing to do until their turn
// comes, so there is no button. Keeping `addToQueue` would have meant either a
// second button that does nothing or a Cancel dressed up as progress — one taps
// to no effect, the other silently costs the reader their place. See
// `ACCESS_STATES` below, where `queued` resolves to NO actions at all.
//
// A CONSEQUENCE FOR `ActionButtonState`: `grantAccess` needs no `doneLabel`. The
// old `addToQueue` flipped to "Added to queue" in place because the button had to
// represent its own aftermath. Here the aftermath is a different resolve
// entirely — `requires_grant` becomes `queued` or `offered` — so the bar redraws
// rather than the button relabelling. `done` may end up with no consumer at all.
//
// `subscribe` STAYS — decided 11 Aug. B2C is not cut. Tapping it resolves the
// title to read + download, if the title falls inside the reader's licence.
//
// `download` IS NOT AN ELITE ACTION — decided 13 Aug, unchanged by the 16 Aug
// flow change. Elite is read-only at every point in the sequence above: no
// offline copy after Accept, and none once a licence is held. That rule lives in
// resolveAccess and never in a component, which is exactly why `download` stays
// in this union — Open Access and Subscription both still use it.

// and they are in the order a reader meets them:

//                      actions; `queuePosition` on the result is what renders.
//   `offered`        — a copy is being offered right now. Resolves to
//                      `acceptOffer` + `rejectOffer`. Reached two ways — straight
//                      back from the tap when nobody was ahead, or later by
//                      notification — and IDENTICAL either way, which is what
//                      lets one surface serve both.

// `requires_queue` is gone: it named the button we no longer draw. `no_seats`

// below for why a seat count still decides nothing.

//
// THE SECOND INPUT TO THE ELITE BRANCH, added 16 Aug. Loan-plus-hold is the whole
// of the Elite decision, and this is the half that separates the three states a
// reader without a copy can be in:
//
//   'none'    → nothing asked for yet          → grantAccess
//   'queued'  → waiting, others ahead          → no actions, render `position`
//   'offered' → a copy is theirs to take now   → acceptOffer + rejectOffer
//
// WHY THIS AND NOT A SEAT COUNT. It would be tempting to ask "are copies free?"
// and branch on the answer. That is a second network call before anything can be
// drawn, and it would make an Elite row resolve differently on a list than on a
// detail screen. The empty-queue and busy-queue cases differ only in WHICH of
// these three values comes back, so the seat count is never needed to pick a
// button. See `Availability` below.

  // `state: 'none'` hold is absence and names nothing. Present whenever `state`
  // is `'queued'` or `'offered'`.
  //
  // NOTE THE STABILITY DIFFERENCE: the hold endpoints are `x-stability: DRAFT`

  holdId?: string;
  // flambeau's id for the OFFER, which is not the same identity as the hold.

  // WHY BOTH. `holdId` is stable from the moment a reader joins the queue and
  // survives queued → offered → lapsed, so it cannot tell two successive offers
  // apart. The rule that the offer store must not let a second offer silently
  // replace a first one is therefore unenforceable on `holdId` alone: the same
  // hold legitimately produces offer after offer. This is what makes "is this the
  // offer I am already holding?" answerable.
  //
  // NOT WHAT ACCEPT AND REJECT ARE ADDRESSED TO — those take `holdId` in the
  // path. This is for identity, not for calls. Present only while state is
  // 'offered'.

  // 'expired' IS A REAL STATE AND NOT A TIDY-UP. An offer that lapses does not
  // return the reader to their old place — flambeau: "the hold is gone rather

  // the back". So a lapsed offer is behaviourally the same as never having asked,
  // which is why it resolves to `requires_grant` and not to `queued`. It is kept
  // distinct from 'none' anyway, because the two are the same ACTION and a very
  // different thing to say to the reader, and only the store can tell them apart.
  //

  // in src/access — the resolve stays pure and is handed the answer.

  offerExpiresAt?: string;
  // The server's clock as at the response that carried this hold, ISO-8601.
  //
  // THE OTHER HALF OF `offerExpiresAt`, and without it that field's rule cannot
  // be honoured. An absolute expiry on its own only yields a countdown when
  // something subtracts a now from it, and the only now available to a component
  // is `Date.now()` — the device clock the comment above forbids. flambeau send
  // this on every loan and hold response and mark it required; we were dropping
  // it at this boundary, so the rule was unfollowable rather than unfollowed.

// The three things that identify one reader's relationship to one title, which is
// what every licence-bearing call takes — DECIDED 16 Aug, and it is deliberately

//
// WHY NOT A LOAN ID. Revoking needs to name the thing being handed back, and the
// obvious candidate is the loan's own id. But that id only exists after a
// borrow has succeeded, so a component holding an `AccessResult` would have to
// carry it around and thread it through, and the one place it went missing would
// be a Revoke button that cannot fire. This triple is knowable from the session
// and the item at every point in the flow, including before anything is held.
//
// `institutionId` IS PART OF IDENTITY, not context. The same title resolves
// differently for two institutions, so a call that omits it is ambiguous even
// when it happens to work.
// A CACHE KEY, NOT A REQUEST PAYLOAD — corrected 17 Aug. The comment above is about
// identity, and it is right about that; what it got wrong is where this shape belongs.
//
// NOTHING SENDS THIS. flambeau's `BorrowRequest` and `HoldRequest` each declare exactly
// one property, `itemId`, and `required: [itemId]`. There is no field to put a user or an
// institution in, so passing them would not be redundant — it would be an unknown field.
// Identity arrives as the authenticated principal off the token: "there is nothing here
// for a caller to assert about itself."
//
// SO WHAT IS IT FOR. Keying anything that remembers a resolve. The same publication
// resolves differently for two institutions, so a cache keyed on `itemId` alone hands a
// reader who switched institution the buttons from the previous one. That is a real need
// and this is the right shape for it — see `AccessResult`, which carries the same two ids
// for the same reason.
//
// The calls take a `BookId`. Earlier drafts of the licence layer took this, on the
// strength of the sentence in `resolveAccess.ts` about the four calls being "keyed by
// `LicenceRef`" — which described the cache and got read as describing the wire.

// list of forty cards costs zero extra requests.
