// src/model/detail.ts
// The shared detail model — one shape behind screen 04 (article) and screen 05
// (book). Week 2 plan: "Screens 04 and 05 are one screen with different fields.
// Build the common part once; both screens depend on it."
//
// WHAT THIS IS: A NARROWING, NOT A NEW SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every field below already
// exists on `Publication` or `AccessResult`. Naming them here states exactly which
// fields the SHARED half of the two screens may draw on, so a field only one
// screen shows — an article's page range, a book's table of contents — cannot be
// reached through it by accident. That is the whole value: the list is short on
// purpose.
//
// NOTHING IS DERIVED, PARSED OR FETCHED. `buildItemDetail` copies. Parsing wire
// data is `normalizePublication`'s job and deciding access is `resolveAccess`'s;
// this sits after both and invents nothing (CONVENTIONS §3 — the UI never
// computes access rights).

  // was built from.

  // Which of the two screens renders: 'article' → screen 04, 'book' → screen 05.
  //
  // THE CALLER STILL SUPPLIES IT because `Publication.workType` is optional —
  // wokay confirms Book and Audiobook (`@type` values), but journal/article are
  // Q-1b (unanswered). `normalizePublication` now fills the field when `@type`
  // maps to a known WorkType; callers fall back to BOOK_WORK_TYPE for everything
  // else. When Q-1b is answered, only `WOKAY_TYPE_MAP` in opds/normalize.ts needs
  // a new entry.
